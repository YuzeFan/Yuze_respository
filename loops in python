 #for loop enables you to execute a code block multiple times
 # For loop example

dates = [2020,2021,2022]
N = len(dates)

for i in range(N):
    print(dates[i])  

# (method2)  

#for year in dates:  
#    print(year)   

#The while loop exists as a tool for repeated execution based on a condition. The code block will keep being executed until the given logical condition returns a False boolean value.
# While Loop Example

dates = [2020,2021,2022,2023,2024]

i = 0
year = dates[0]

while(year != 2023):    
    print(year)
    i = i + 1
    year = dates[i]
    

print("It took ", i ,"repetitions to get out of loop.")

while(i < len(PlayListRatings) and Rating >= 6):
    print(Rating)
    Rating = PlayListRatings[i]
    i = i + 1
